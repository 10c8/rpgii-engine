RPGii is a ASCII-based open-source RPG (not roguelike) game engine that features (well, in the future versions):
- Colors!
- Quests!
- Dungeons!
- Monsters!
- NPC villages and cities!
- And... Bosses! >:D (maybe more things, I don't know)

This project still just a concept, but with some time and work it can be a great engine! :D
It's main coded in pure C++, but it can use some frameworks (maybe, but still being ASCII-based).
